##About "Lightning Talks: 6"

This is our 6th Installment of Community Lightning Talks. Never heard of a lightning talk? Here is what's up:

Lightning Talks are really fun. They an open forum where our members can get up and talk about what they want. The talks need to be short - generally 5-10 minutes. You can cover anything that is javascript, or related to javascript. You can talk about a problem you've solved, a plugin you like, a cool blog post you read, something you’re working on now, or pretty much any other way you’re using JavaScript to achieve your goals.

We run a signup on the Google G+ community for OKC.js.  Generally? Be sure and sign up early; they fill up quickly
