## About "Important Talk About Important Things"
We all want to learn how to efficiently create solutions in a reliable, secure, and professional manner. Sometimes our priorities change and what we really need to know is how to embed an easter egg in our application that changes all the font to emojis. This talk will cover mission critical things such as adding easter eggs, creating your own fonts, and text animation.
