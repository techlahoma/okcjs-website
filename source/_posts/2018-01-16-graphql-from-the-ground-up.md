## About "GraphQL from the Ground Up"
This talk will introduce GraphQL from the ground up. We'll go over what it is, what problems it solves, and what it looks like. We'll talk about what setting up a working GraphQL endpoint looks like, and how it simplifies data fetching on the client. And along the way we'll touch on the incredibly rich ecosystem of tools that make all of these things simpler.

## About Adam Rackis
After a brief stint in the Air Force, Adam began his career as a software developer here in Oklahoma City. In the more than decade since, he’s coded over a wide variety of languages, technologies and frameworks. Most recently he’s developed an unhealthy obsession with JavaScript, and the React stack in particular. When he’s not coding, his interests include fitness, reading, and of course being a husband and father.
