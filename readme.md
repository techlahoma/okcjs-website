## About OKC.js

‚è≥ What's the history of OKC.js?  
OKC.js started in January 2012 with 72 attendees. We currently range from 50-100+ members at our lunch time meetup. We organize the meetup with a couple organizers and volunteers. If you're interested in helping out, send us an [email](mailto:oklahomacityjavascript@gmail.com), [tweet](https://twitter.com/okcjs) or start contributing via [GitHub](https://github.com/techlahoma/okcjs-website).

üéØ What are common topics at OKC.js  
Topics at OKC.js range from JS on the client side, server side, optimization, frameworks, libraries, testing, IDE tips, best practices, and personal projects.

üíû Who should attend?  
This group is for people of all levels and all skills. We recommend attending especially  if you feel that you don't belong due to being new to JavaScript, tech in general, or the OKC area. It is impossible to know everything or be an expert in every matter, but it *is* possible to learn something new at every OKC.js meeting. Every meeting we learn about new tech to discover better ways to solve our problems with code, and make new friends. Attending is an investment in yourself and our tech community! Please [RSVP](http://meetup.com/OKC-JS) and find this out for yourself.

üíñ What is the OKC.js community like?  
OKC.js is made up of  members from varying backgrounds. Some have recently decided they want to learn more about technology, the tech industry, and if a career in programming is right for them. Some attendees are students at high schools, vo-techs, 2 year schools, or 4 year universities. Some attendees are in their first few years or fifteenth year in tech.

‚ö° What are Lightning Talks?  
‚ö°Lightning Talks‚ö° are every third month.  They're a really fun event we put on every 3 months. Community members have 5 to 10 minutes to talk about JavaScript or topics related to JavaScript. We give preference to new speakers to strengthen our community. Anyone who has attended OKC.js once before is invited to [sign up](http://www.meetup.com/OKC-js/messages/boards/). Selected speakers will be notified of their status. Common topics include: libraries, ways you've solved problems, what you're working on, or anything relating to JS.  Please note that marketing pitches are not allowed; lightning talks are a community enrichment event. Thusly, we do not accept talks that sell products, goods, or services.

üì¨ How can I contact OKC.js?  
Tweet to us at [@okcjs](https://twitter.com/okcjs), post a comment/question or create a new thread in our [GitHub repo](http://github.com/techlahoma/okcjs-website), post a question on [Meetup](https://meetup.com/OKC-js) in an event or discussion thread, send us an [email](mailto:oklahomacityjavascript@gmail.com), or post a question in the Techlahoma [Slack channel](http://techlahoma.slack.com). (Join the Techlahoma Slack channel [here](http://slack.techlahoma.org).) We'll try to respond as soon as possible.

üíµ Is OKC.js free?  
Yes! OKC.js has been, and always will be, a free monthly training event. We organize and speak at OKC.js for the betterment of Oklahoma's tech community. '*Advancing Oklahoma's grassroots technology community*' is the Techlahoma Foundation's mission.
If you or your company would like to sponsor pizza and soda for OKC.js we do accept [donations](https://donate.techlahoma.org) via the [Techlahoma Foundation](http://techlahoma.org).

üîä I like what you're doing! How can I help?

## Website Contributions

Want to contribute to the site? Great! Helping with the website via markdown, GitHub, and pull requests is a great way to be involved. You'll be learning/using relevant skills for Oklahoma's developer job market while contributing to our tech community. Pretty cool, right? üòé  

This repo holds the basis for the Oklahoma City JavaScript user group's website. This is asimply blog-type site powered by hexo, using the okcjs-hexo-theme. This currently supports multiple languages, and also has the ability to add plugins, as necessary.

### Getting Started

#### Short Version

```sh
 git clone git@github.com:techlahoma/okcjs-website.git
 cd okcjs-website
 git clone https://github.com/techlahoma/hexo-theme-okcjs.git themes/okcjs
 npm install
 hexo server
```

#### Longer Version:
1. Make sure you have [node](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed.
2. Install hexo if you haven't already. ```npm install hexo -g```
3. Clone the repository.
  * If you already have cloned the repo, please check that your clone is up to date.
4. Clone the okcjs theme into ```themes/okcjs/```
  * hexo-theme-okcjs repo: [https://github.com/techlahoma/hexo-theme-okcjs](https://github.com/techlahoma/hexo-theme-okcjs)
5. Run ```npm install``` from the root folder of your cloned repo.
  * Even though you've installed hexo, you must do this after the initial cloning.
6. You can start the server with ```hexo server``` on the command line.
7. Always submit new posts as a pull request. **Do not push directly to master.**
8. Full hexo documentation located at [http://hexo.io/docs/](http://hexo.io/docs/).

### Posting Events

Posts are located in _posts. The easiest way to write a new one is simply to type ```hexo new "Your Post Name"``` It will scaffold one for you. Nice.

Go ahead and Make the post you want to make. If you don't like it we can delete it later, no big deal. Now, type ```hexo server```. Hexo starts on port (in this case 4000);

When you have it like you like, do ```hexo generate``` this spits out all the static content.

### Menu
You can add a page with ```hexo new page "pagename"``` . You can add it to the menu by editing the _config.yml located in the metro-light folder

### Deploy

Easy mode. When on the master branch, after you have merged a pull request to Techlahoma's repo: ```hexo deploy --generate```

Boom. Its on gh pages here [http://techlahoma.github.io/okcjs-website/](http://techlahoma.github.io/okcjs-website/)

### If something goes wrong.

The magic words: ```hexo clean``` then ```hexo generate``` This will recreate everything.

*Did you forget to run* ```npm install```*?*
