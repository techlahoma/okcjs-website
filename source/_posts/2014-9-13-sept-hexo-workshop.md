## About our Instructors

### Jesse Harlin

I work as a Javascript application architect at Telogical Systems where I work with an awesome team making cutting edge web applications. When I'm not doing this, I am very active in the local technology community. I help run the Oklahoma City Javascript Usergroup, Techlahoma and co-organize Thunder Plains, one of Oklahoma's most relevant Javascript and web technology conferences. 
I love my wife, making cool sounds on my synthesizers and building cool stuff with Javascript.

### Jessica Campbell

I am a .Net developer by day and a bookworm by night. My wife, Collin, is a starving artist and is designing a board game. We have two cats named Katy and Lottie, they're tuxedo cats so they are always dressed for formal affairs.
